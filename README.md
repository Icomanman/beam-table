# ACI Beam Design Table

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/91nEMc-5Gyk

#### GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Icomanman/beam-table

#### Description:

This is a web app inspired by my work as a structural engineer. Much of the calculations involved in the design of reinforced concrete beams are a bit repetitive, hence I made this app to be able to provide a quick reference for their design under the (American Concrete Institute) ACI code. Furthermore, presenting the data in this way (table format) would give the user a more wider sense in terms of different options on section sizes, material properties and other related details.

Ultimately, the design process would be a lot efficient and simpler this way once design forces are available, all the engineer has to do is to match them with the values on the table.

#### Frameworks and Tools
